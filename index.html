  <h1 id="main-heading">Who am I?</h1>
  <h2 id="name">Vaughn Zamudio</h2>
  <p id="intro">Hey! I'm Vaughn Zamudio! I'm a first-year Game Design and Experiential Media Major.</p>

  <h3 id="pets-heading">Pets</h3>
  <p id="pets-info">I love animals and pets. I used to have a dog and am constantly taking care of my neighbor's cat and dog since they like to travel a lot.</p>
  <p id="pet-image-description">Here's an image of me walking my neighbor's dog.</p>
  <img id="pet-image" src="Media/DogWalking.jpg" alt="Walking Neighbors dog">

  <h3 id="sports-heading">Sports and Clubs</h3>
  <p id="sports-info">I'm a big fan of table tennis and I'm vice president of the IIT Table Tennis Club. But when it comes to sports, baseball is my real love. Having lived in Chicago my whole life, I cheer for both the Cubs and the Sox (controversial, I know).</p>
  <p id="sports-video-description">Here's a video of me playing Table tennis with my phone (it's low quality but I was just having fun with my friends).</p>

  <h3 id="music-heading">Music</h3>
  <p id="music-info">Music is a big part of my life. I'm always listening to something on Spotify throughout my day as a background soundtrack.</p>
  <p id="album-goal">One of my goals is to eventually put out some sort of musical album and get together a band of friends. I think it would be fun to make my own music, and I'd explore all different genres.</p>
  <p id="music-taste">My music taste is all over the place and constantly changing, but right now, I'm really into classic and psychedelic rock.</p>
  <p id="favorite-albums">Some of my favorite albums are Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars, Beatles White Album, Odessey and Oracle by the Zombies, Nevermind by Nirvana, and Congratulations by MGMT.</p>

  <h3 id="reading-heading">Reading</h3>
  <p id="reading-info">Reading is also another important part of my life, though I haven't been reading as much lately.</p>
  <p id="started-reading">I actually started reading with classics. This was just because I had a lot of classics in my house because my father’s a librarian.</p> 
  <p id="classic-preference">I like a lot of different classics but I prefer the humorist ones, such as Dickens and Twain, which are favorites.</p>
  <p id="fantasy-reading">Fantasy was also something I read a lot of as a kid, with favorites being Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, and The Way of Kings.</p> 
  <p id="graphic-novels">Recently, I've gotten into graphic novels and manga. I enjoyed Watchmen, Hellboy Series, Delicious in Dungeon, and Jujutsu Kaisen.</p>
